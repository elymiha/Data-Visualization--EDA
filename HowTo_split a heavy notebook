# Step-by-Step Guide

1. Split Your Code into Separate Notebooks

First, identify logical sections of your code that can be separated into different notebooks. For example, you might have:

Notebook 1: Data loading and preprocessing
Notebook 2: Feature engineering
Notebook 3: Model training
Notebook 4: Model evaluation

2. Save Each Section as a Separate Notebook

Create new Jupyter Notebooks for each section and copy the relevant code into these notebooks. Save them with appropriate names, such as:

data_loading.ipynb
feature_engineering.ipynb
model_training.ipynb
model_evaluation.ipynb

3. Convert Notebooks to Python Scripts

To import one notebook into another, you need to convert them to Python scripts. You can do this using the nbconvert tool.

Run the following command in your terminal for each notebook:

bash

jupyter nbconvert --to script data_loading.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to script feature_engineering.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to script model_training.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to script model_evaluation.ipynb

This will create Python scripts (.py files) for each notebook:

data_loading.py
feature_engineering.py
model_training.py
model_evaluation.py
  
4. Import Python Scripts in Notebooks

Now, you can import these Python scripts into your notebooks. Open the notebook that needs to import the code from another notebook and add an import statement at the beginning.
