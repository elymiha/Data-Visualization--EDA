Food production impact evaluation and rapresentation

Our world population is projected to grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in the year 2050. To make things even more complicated, the Earth's climate is changing and is being affected by agriculture. As the world population has expanded and enriched, the demand for food, energy and water has seen a rapid increase.

The above described trends would have more and more impact on the quality and duration of our life. Therefore, we have to urgently tackle these issues in order to find solutions for:

  * changing the way food gets cultivated
  * changing the way food gets distributed globally
  * changing the way each of us are eating

In this notebook, I am addressing topics such food/ feed production and distribution as well as food production environmental impact.

The purpose of this work is to provide insights and graphical representations useful to take more conscious decisions in the fields of:

 * food and feed production
 * food and feed consumption
 * food production environmental impact
 
The notebook's content is written following the exploratory data analysis setting which is an approach used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations. In this specific case, the explanation is being articulated into the following chapters:

  * DATA DISCOVERY
  * DATA CLEANING
  * DATA EXPLORATION
  * DATA TRASFORMATION
  * DATA VISUALIZATION

In conclusion, all study and data analysis will be oriented at answering the following questions:

  * What are the fastest growing countries in terms of food production?
  * What are the differences between food and feed production?
  * How diversified is the food/feed offer?
  * Which types of food have more negative impact on the environment?
  * How much each stage of food production contributes to the total emission?
  * How much each food type contributes to Eutrophying and GreenhouseGas emissions?
  * What is the impact of food production on other resources (water, land)?
